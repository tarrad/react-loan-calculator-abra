First, I looked at how other loan websites are designed to get some ideas for my own project.

I used the following third-party libraries:
1. slider (rc-slider).
2. tool tip - (react-tooltip)

My goal was to create a solution that's clean and easy to use,I wanted it to be similar to what I’ve seen on other loan provider sites like banks or Mimun Yashir.

I decided to use React because I have experience with it from my own projects, though I also know Vue.

The UI is simple and flexible, and we can adjust it however needed to meet the customer’s requirements.
